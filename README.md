# HRTF_relearning_data
This repository holds the dataset for the study "Adaptation rate and persistence across multiple sets of spectral cues for sound localisation" 
by Paul Friedrich and Marc Sch√∂nwiesner, 2024

The dataset has the following folder structure:
Participant ID / Condition 
Each participant/condition folder contains:
- a <participant_id>.sofa file, which stores the raw measured DTFs
- the results of the consecutive localization tests as pickle files, titled "localization_<participant id>_<date>,
  which can easily be read with the "slab" python package, using the trialsequence class
- the folder "processed_hrtf> containing the processed DTFs 
- the folder "in_ear_recordings "containing the recordings with the in-ear microphones that were used to compute the DTFs

please refer to the methods section for a detailed description of recording, DTF calculation and processing
