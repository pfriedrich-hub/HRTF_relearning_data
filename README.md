# HRTF_relearning_data
This repository holds the dataset for the study "Adaptation rate and persistence across multiple sets of spectral cues for sound localisation" 
by Paul Friedrich and Marc Sch√∂nwiesner, 2024

The dataset has the following folder structure:

Participant ID / Condition 

Each participant/condition folder contains:
- a <participant_id>.sofa file, which stores the raw measured DTFs
- a folder "processed_hrtf" containing the processed DTFs
- the results of the localization tests as pickle files, titled "localization_'participant-id'_'date'", 
  which were created using the trialsequence class of the "slab" python package
- the folder "in_ear_recordings" containing the recordings obtained from the in-ear microphones, which were used to compute the DTFs

please refer to the methods section for a detailed description of recording, DTF calculation and processing
